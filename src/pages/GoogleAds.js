      <h2>The Power of Google Ads</h2>
      <p>
        Google Ads, formerly known as Google AdWords, is one of the most effective online advertising platforms available today. It allows businesses to create highly targeted ads that appear when potential customers search for specific keywords or phrases related to their services. With Google Ads, you can reach your target audience at the exact moment they are actively looking for construction services, making it a powerful tool for lead generation.
